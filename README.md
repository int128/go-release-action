# go-actions

This repository provides general-purpose actions for Go.


## setup [![setup](https://github.com/int128/go-actions/actions/workflows/setup.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/int128/go-actions/actions/workflows/setup.yaml)

This action runs `actions/setup-go` with `actions/cache`.

For example,

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: int128/go-actions/setup@v1
        with:
          go-version: 1.18.5
      - uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v3
        with:
          version: v1.48.0

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: int128/go-actions/setup@v1
        with:
          go-version: 1.18.5
      - run: go test -v -race ./...
```


## release [![release](https://github.com/int128/go-actions/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/int128/go-actions/actions/workflows/release.yaml)

This action builds an archive and digest, and releases them into GitHub Releases on tag event.

- `NAME_GOOS_GOARCH.zip`
- `NAME_GOOS_GOARCH.zip.sha256`

For example,

```yaml
name: release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    paths:
      - .github/workflows/release.yaml
      - '**.go'
      - go.*
    tags:
      - v*
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
    paths:
      - .github/workflows/release.yaml
      - '**.go'
      - go.*

jobs:

        platform:
          - runs-on: ubuntu-latest
